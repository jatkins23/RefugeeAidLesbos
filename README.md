# RefugeeAidLesbos

# Problem Statement
Currently in Lesvos, the refugees have no database of information regarding the essentials needed. This app focuses on providing information for refugees and migrants in Lesvos. We are providing information about shelters, food and water, medical, transit and emergency numbers in a simple web interface. Users will also be able to acknowledge whether the service listed still exists and if it worked. 

# Technologies Used
- Ruby on Rails, Google Maps API, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript

#Set up
1. git clone [https://github.com/jatkins23/RefugeeAidLesbos.git](https://github.com/jatkins23/RefugeeAidLesbos.git)
2. cd RefugeeAidLesbos
3. bundle install
4. rake db:create
5. rake db:migrate
6. rake db:seed
7. rails server

# Future Projects
Since the majority of refugees use Android devices, we plan on turning this application into an Android app, so that it is mobile responsive and accessible even offline.
